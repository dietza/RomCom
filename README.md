## Description

> In this paired project we created an app to generate romance novel covers. Learning goals related to this project included:
* Writing clean, DRY Javascript to store data
* Using a provided class to create object instances using the `new ` keyword
* Manipulating the page after it was loaded adding, removing, and updating elements on the DOM

* When the page loads, we see a cover with a randomly selected image, title, and tagline which includes two random descriptors.

* Every time the user clicks the Show New Random Cover button, a new random cover is created.
